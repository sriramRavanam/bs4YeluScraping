When we talk about short term job-base programme, the idea of merchant navy seems exiting. There are different academies which conduct one year or 3 years marine programmes. But they of course consume a lot of time and money and and not immediate job oriented programmes. Here. at Siroi Maritime Academy, the theoretical and practical contents of professional training is covered and applied just in 4 months. Job is assured within next two months. But wait ! every marine programme cost you high. For short term training programme your overall expenditure is 3-4 lakhs and for long term 6-12 Lakhs depending upon the duration of the course and where the training is going to be conducted and several other expects. What makes you psychologically ready, is when you come to know about your fee structure, but what turns you unemployed, is your ignorance about the other charges which are not disclosed by the academies. So do not forget to inquiry about the total expenditure till you join the ship, and the verification of the information provided to you.
